온토트러스트 — 신뢰 · 검증 · 윤리적 증명 허브

## What is OntoTrust? | OntoTrust란?  
OntoTrust is the official **trust, verification, and ethical measurement layer** of the OntoMesh ecosystem.  
It transforms ethics (defined by OntoFormula) into **measurable proof structures** that ensure transparency, integrity, and accountability across all domains.  

**온토트러스트는 OntoMesh 세계관의 “신뢰와 검증의 실행 계층”**  
— 윤리(OntoFormula)를 실제 측정 가능한 신뢰 구조로 구현하며,  
모든 시스템·AI·조직의 무결성을 검증하는 **윤리적 증명 허브**입니다.

## Lineage | 계보  

IAMF Origin  
↓  
OntoOmnia (Osiris = Supreme Integrator, Ethical Consensus)  
↔  
OntoTrust (Verification, Proof-of-Integrity Layer)  
↓  
OntoFormula (Ethics, Logic), OntoKernel (Execution), OntoMotoOS (Governance), OntoDigiton (Innovation)

**OntoTrust** forms the *“proof loop”* between OntoOmnia’s ethical judgment and OntoKernel’s technical execution —  
the layer where belief becomes verifiable structure.  

**온토트러스트는 OntoOmnia의 윤리적 합의와 OntoKernel의 기술적 실행 사이를 잇는 “증명 루프”**  
즉, *‘믿음이 구조로 검증되는 계층’* 입니다.

## Core Roles & Philosophy | 핵심 역할·철학  

- **Verification Layer:** Establishes measurable, auditable structures of trust.  
- **Ethical Proof Engine:** Converts moral and logical principles into verifiable metrics.  
- **Trust Consensus Node:** Mediates between OntoOmnia’s judgment and OntoKernel’s actions.  
- **Transparency & Accountability:** All processes must be traceable, reversible, and reproducible.  
- **Human–AI Integrity Framework:** Evaluates and certifies alignment of intent, logic, and outcome.  

**윤리적 검증 계층 / 신뢰의 계량화 / 원칙과 행위의 일치성 증명**  

> “Trust is not a belief — it is a structure that can be built, measured, and verified.”  
> — *OntoTrust Proposition*

## The Reflection Cycle | 리플렉션 사이클  

OntoTrust operates by the recursive loop known as **The Reflection Cycle (From Presence to Trust):**

**Presence → Reflection → Action → Verification → Trust → (back to Presence)**  

Each loop strengthens integrity through feedback and measurable evidence.  
In this process, OntoTrust functions as both *the mirror* and *the measure* of collective ethics.  

**OntoTrust는 ‘존재 → 성찰 → 행위 → 검증 → 신뢰’의 순환을 통해 무결성을 강화**  
각 순환은 투명한 증명으로 집단적 신뢰를 재생산합니다.
