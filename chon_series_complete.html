<section id="introduction-expanded">
    <h1>Comprehensive Introduction — “The 1-Chon Has Not Disappeared. It Has Simply Taken a Different Form.”</h1>
    <p>We often believe that the way we form relationships has completely changed every time a new SNS platform emerges.</p>

    <p>The 1-chon of Cyworld disappeared, Facebook friends appeared, Instagram shifted to a follower-centric system, and Twitter feels like a public square open to everyone.</p>

    <p>However, when we look more closely, we are still living within the old relational structure called “1-chon.”</p>

    <p>The platforms have changed, but human psychology, social distance, access to information, and the weight of relationships still operate under the ancient question:</p>

    <p><strong>“What threshold must be crossed for two people to become connected?”</strong></p>

    <p>An interesting truth is that relationships on today’s SNS are not simply divided into “close vs. distant.”</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Functional and lightweight 1-chon (general users)</li>
        <li>Heavy 1-chon based on intellectual resonance (the world of a certain profile)</li>
        <li>Platform-specific variations of 1-chon (Close Friends, Neighbors, mutuals, etc.)</li>
        <li>Re-emerging selective network structures in the AI era</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this suggests that the act of “connecting” is, in essence, a philosophical choice.</p>

    <p>People design the architecture of their relationships far more precisely than we assume — deciding “whom to accept and whom to keep at a distance.”</p>

    <p>This series is a journey to dissect the structure and psychology of relationships, and the philosophy of platforms, hidden behind the everyday buttons we casually press: “request,” “accept.”</p>

    <p>We will explore how the concept that began as Cyworld’s 1-chon expanded into Facebook, Instagram, X, Naver Blog, and KakaoTalk, and how it has once again resurfaced in a highly refined form on LinkedIn.</p>

    <p>We will also examine the dramatic contrast between lightweight 1-chon relationships among general users and the weighty 1-chon formed by specific profiles — individuals who possess depth and intellectual substance.</p>

    <p>This series consists of seven parts:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Has the 1-Chon Really Disappeared? — The Original Architecture of Relationships</li>
        <li>LinkedIn: The Most Sophisticated 1-Chon System That Remains</li>
        <li>The 1-Chon of General Users: The Psychology of Lightweight Networking</li>
        <li>The 1-Chon of Depth-Based Profiles: Intellectual Resonance and Meaningful Connection</li>
        <li>The Survival Patterns of 1-Chon Across SNS Platforms — A Platform Architecture Analysis</li>
        <li>Polarized 1-Chon — Lightweight Connections vs. Meaningful Connections</li>
        <li>The Future of Social Networks: Relationships Become a Technology of Choice Again</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Through these seven chapters, we will delve into one central question:</p>

    <p><strong>“Why do we connect? And why do some relationships become special?”</strong></p>

    <p>The 1-chon of the past was a simple feature, but the modern 1-chon has become a philosophical event — one that reflects our identity, psychology, and the structure of meaning.</p>
</section>


    <!-- Main Body Sections -->
<section id="series-1">
    <h1>Series 1. Has the 1-Chon Really Disappeared? — The Original Architecture of Relationships</h1>

    <p>People often say:</p>
    <p>“Isn’t there no such thing as 1-chon in today’s SNS?”</p>
    <p>“Since we live in the follower era, isn’t that concept meaningless now?”</p>

    <p>But if we look a little deeper, the 1-chon has never disappeared.</p>
    <p>Rather, it has changed its form and permeated almost every SNS we use.</p>

    <p>Its traces are not simply remnants of an outdated feature. They are evidence of how the <strong>social architecture</strong> of relationships is embedded in human psychology and platform philosophy.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Cyworld’s 1-Chon: The Prototype of a “Relationship OS”</h2>

    <p>In the early 2000s, Cyworld determined the digital relationship model of Koreans through a single concept: the “1-chon.”</p>

    <p>The 1-chon embodied:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A mutually agreed relationship, not a one-way follow</li>
        <li>A permission-based structure allowing access to each other’s diaries</li>
        <li>Intimacy level differentiation through visibility settings</li>
        <li>A hierarchical way to distinguish “people you know” from “people you’re close to”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Back then, we did not realize that this structure would later become the foundational language of all SNS platforms.</p>

    <p>Cyworld wasn’t merely a service — it was a <strong>digital relationship operating system (OS)</strong>.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. Why Did the 1-Chon Seem to Disappear?</h2>

    <p>As Cyworld declined and Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter emerged, the shape of relationships appeared to change dramatically.</p>

    <p>Facebook introduced “friends,” but in essence, it was simply a renamed version of the 1-chon.</p>

    <p>Instagram shifted to a follower-based system, weakening the idea of reciprocity.</p>

    <p>Twitter (X) transformed into an open-graph structure where anyone could access anyone.</p>

    <p>On the surface, the 1-chon seemed to vanish.</p>

    <p>But this was merely a change in appearance.  
    The essence of relationships — and the structural mechanics that determine access — quietly remained.</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. The Essence of Relationships Is “Distance”</h2>

    <p>The relational structure of SNS begins with a single question:</p>

    <p><strong>“How close are you to me?”</strong></p>

    <p>The 1-chon was a mechanism that defined the “closest point” in that question.</p>

    <p>Even as platforms change, humans still want to design distance.</p>

    <p>That is why Instagram created “Close Friends,”  
    Naver Blog created “Neighbors,”  
    Facebook still maintains a two-way approval structure through “Friends.”</p>

    <p>This is not simply a feature — it proves that the essence of relationships is still alive.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. LinkedIn: The Modern Revival of the 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>LinkedIn is particularly fascinating.</p>

    <p>It preserves the Cyworld-style 1-chon structure almost as it was:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1st degree connections</li>
        <li>2nd degree connections</li>
        <li>3rd degree connections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This structure is not just a curiosity.  
    It determines multiple real functions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Information access rights</li>
        <li>Search priority</li>
        <li>Algorithmic exposure</li>
        <li>Possibility of direct conversation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, LinkedIn has resurrected the philosophy of the 1-chon as a professional network system.</p>

    <p>It is the purest “1-chon system” among modern SNS platforms.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. Platforms Change, But Human Psychology Does Not</h2>

    <p>Technology evolves, but human nature changes far less.</p>

    <p>People still distinguish between:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Permission and non-permission</li>
        <li>Closeness and distance</li>
        <li>Meaningful and meaningless relationships</li>
        <li>People who are accessible and people who are difficult to access</li>
    </ul>

    <p>SNS simply expresses these distinctions in platform-specific ways.</p>

    <p>In Cyworld, it was “1-chon,”  
    in Instagram, “Close Friends,”  
    in blogs, “Neighbors,”  
    in X, “Mutuals,”  
    in LinkedIn, “1st degree.”</p>

    <p>All of these point to one conclusion:  
    Relationships are not a matter of technology — they are matters of deep human psychology.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. Conclusion of Part 1</h2>

    <p>The 1-chon has not disappeared.</p>

    <p>In the human mind,  
    within the functions of our platforms,  
    and in the “request” and “accept” buttons we press every day,  
    its philosophy continues to live.</p>

    <p>In the next part of this series, we will explore how this old relational architecture evolves across platforms, how it operates according to psychological factors, why some relationships become light, and why others become heavy.</p>
</section>


<section id="series-2">
    <h1>Series 2. LinkedIn: The Most Sophisticated 1-Chon System That Remains</h1>

    <p>Even after Cyworld disappeared, the 1-chon system did not vanish completely.  
    Its philosophy revived in the most sophisticated and powerful form on LinkedIn.</p>

    <p>Most people understand LinkedIn merely as a “business SNS.”  
    But when we examine its internal structure, LinkedIn is the only SNS that precisely measures the “relational distance” between users and decides information access and exposure levels accordingly.</p>

    <p>This is not simply reminiscent of Cyworld — it is arguably the completed, modern version of the 1-chon system.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. LinkedIn’s “1st–2nd–3rd Degree Structure” Is Not a Simple Feature</h2>

    <p>LinkedIn’s fundamental relationship system consists of three levels:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1st-degree connection</li>
        <li>2nd-degree</li>
        <li>3rd-degree</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This structure is not just a “friend of a friend” hierarchy.  
    LinkedIn designs its entire algorithm based on this distance framework.</p>

    <p>✔ Priority of post exposure<br>
       ✔ Feed composition<br>
       ✔ Search results<br>
       ✔ Ability to send messages<br>
       ✔ Information visibility<br>
       ✔ Loading of past activity<br>
    </p>

    <p>All of these elements vary depending on the <strong>relational distance (degree)</strong>.</p>

    <p>In short, LinkedIn interprets:</p>

    <p><strong>Relational distance = Permission layer</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 2. The “Role and Power” of the 1st Degree</h2>

    <p>✔ <strong>1) Direct messages fully open</strong><br>
    1st-degree connections can freely exchange messages.  
    In a business network, this functionality is invaluable.</p>

    <p>✔ <strong>2) Increased post exposure</strong><br>
    LinkedIn’s algorithm operates on the principle of “show to 1st degree first, and more.”  
    Thus, 1st-degree connections become the primary window for mutual activity exposure.</p>

    <p>✔ <strong>3) Access to past posts</strong><br>
    General users can often view only limited public posts,  
    but 1st-degree connections can scroll through everything, including connections-only posts.  
    This is structurally identical to Cyworld’s “diary visible only to 1-chon.”</p>

    <p>✔ <strong>4) Deeper profile analysis</strong><br>
    1st-degree connections can view deeper layers of information — career, activity history, post patterns — more fully.</p>

    <p>✔ <strong>5) The algorithm treats 1st-degree connections as “close relationships”</strong><br>
    Therefore, the more 1st-degree connections you have, the more diverse your feed becomes, exposure increases, and even search priority improves.</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. A “Degree-Based Optimization Algorithm” That Other SNS Do Not Have</h2>

    <p>Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook all rely on a following/follower model.  
    But LinkedIn is the only SNS that uses <strong>degree (relational distance)</strong> as the core of its algorithm.</p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1st degree → Most visible to you</li>
        <li>2nd degree → Indirect exposure through 1st degree content</li>
        <li>3rd degree → Visible mainly in search</li>
        <li>No relation → Almost no exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>LinkedIn is not just an SNS —  
    it is an information network built on relational architecture.</p>

    <p>This is why LinkedIn remains the only platform that maintains a complete 1-chon system.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. Why Connection Requests and Acceptances Are NOT “Lightweight Friend Additions”</h2>

    <p>In general SNS:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Follows are one-directional</li>
        <li>Friend requests are light in meaning</li>
        <li>Access differences are minimal</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But on LinkedIn, connection requests and acceptances carry structural meaning:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Granting access rights</li>
        <li>Starting algorithmic influence in the feed</li>
        <li>Expanding network graph connections</li>
        <li>Opening message channels</li>
        <li>Sharing scroll-level content access</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, a LinkedIn 1st-degree connection is not a simple “friend add.”  
    It is a mutual agreement to join an information-exchange network.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. The REAL Difference Between Cyworld’s and LinkedIn’s 1-Chon</h2>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Cyworld</th>
            <th>LinkedIn</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Emotion-centered personal relations</td>
            <td>Professional network-centered</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Diaries, photos</td>
            <td>Posts, career history, work records</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Emotional visibility</td>
            <td>Information access rights</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Intimacy-driven</td>
            <td>Work/competence-driven</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Closed</td>
            <td>Semi-open + structural</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Yet both platforms ask the same question:</p>

    <p><strong>“How much access will you allow me?”</strong></p>

    <p>Cyworld demanded an emotional threshold,  
    while LinkedIn demands an informational threshold.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. Why the LinkedIn 1st Degree Has “Weight”</h2>

    <p>The 1st degree on LinkedIn carries unavoidable heaviness.  
    The reasons are clear:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The depth of post access changes</li>
        <li>Algorithmic priority shifts</li>
        <li>Message permissions open</li>
        <li>The network graph is affected</li>
        <li>It signals a mutually recognized “professional relationship”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, a LinkedIn 1st-degree connection is an act of opening a door at an informational and professional level.  
    In today’s SNS ecosystem, LinkedIn is essentially the only platform with this degree of meaning.</p>

    <h2>🔹 7. Conclusion of Part 2</h2>

    <p>Cyworld’s 1-chon philosophy was designed around emotional relationships.  
    LinkedIn’s 1-chon system, however, evolved into a more sophisticated and structural system centered on professional networks.</p>

    <p>Therefore, a LinkedIn 1st-degree connection is neither lightweight nor a simple friend add.  
    It is far more meaningful than a follow — an agreement of access based on informational trust.</p>

    <p>This is why LinkedIn is the only true 1-chon platform among modern SNS.</p>
</section>


<section id="series-3">
    <h1>Series 3. The 1-Chon of General Users: The Psychology of Lightweight Networking</h1>

    <p>No matter how sophisticated LinkedIn’s 1-chon structure may be, most people do not use it deeply.  
    Paradoxically, LinkedIn is also a platform where “light requests and light acceptances” are everywhere.</p>

    <p>In this part, we analyze why the 1-chon is consumed as a “meaningless relationship” among general users and examine its psychological structure.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Most Users See the 1-Chon as a “Network Number”</h2>

    <p>Many newcomers to LinkedIn try to increase their number of 1st-degree connections as if they were raising a game score.</p>

    <p>“Let’s just connect for now.”<br>
       “Having more connections makes me look good.”<br>
       “Wouldn’t it help to have lots of recruiters?”<br>
       “There’s no downside to adding people anyway.”</p>

    <p>These thoughts combine to form the equation:</p>

    <p><strong>1-chon = Number (Quantity)</strong></p>

    <p>In psychology, this is called “visible achievement.”  
    When the visible number increases, people feel as though their expertise has increased — even though it hasn’t.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. Sending Requests Is Too Easy</h2>

    <p>Similar to Facebook friend requests, LinkedIn connection requests are completed with one click.</p>

    <p>If the company names are slightly similar,  
    if the industries overlap even a little,  
    if the name feels familiar,  
    or even if the profile photo is memorable —  
    people simply send the request.</p>

    <p>As a result:</p>

    <p><strong>80% of requests are sent without any deep meaning.</strong></p>

    <p>This is because LinkedIn’s design (button-based interaction + auto recommendations + algorithmic matching) reinforces “light-touch attempts.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. Acceptance Is Light Too — A “Relationship That Doesn’t Need to Be Rejected”</h2>

    <p>There is almost no reason to hesitate when accepting on LinkedIn.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Nothing bad happens even if you don’t know the person</li>
        <li>You accept as long as the message isn't spam</li>
        <li>Disconnecting later does not notify the other person</li>
        <li>More 1st-degree connections make your account look more active</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All these factors combine so that:</p>

    <p><strong>Acceptance = A routine click with little meaning</strong></p>

    <p>In other words, the request–accept cycle does not create relationships — it operates like a “button loop.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. A Platform Culture That Does Not Demand Depth</h2>

    <p>Although meaningful content and deep thinking certainly exist on LinkedIn, most general users behave far more simply.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Short posts</li>
        <li>Self-promotion</li>
        <li>Link sharing</li>
        <li>Reposting company news</li>
        <li>Auto-recommended comments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The structure reinforces light activity rather than deep relationships.  
    Therefore, the 1-chon naturally becomes a lightweight network.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. If the Minimum Condition of “Reciprocity” Is Met, It Becomes a 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>General users have very simple criteria for accepting a connection request:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Will this person cause me any particular harm?</li>
        <li>Is the person spam?</li>
        <li>Does the profile look normal?</li>
        <li>Is the industry not strangely irrelevant?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If these four conditions are met, most people accept.</p>

    <p>This is completely different from Cyworld’s 1-chon, which was based on emotion and intimacy.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. Ultimately, the 1-Chon of General Users Is a “Lightweight Connection Network”</h2>

    <p>General users do not recognize the 1-chon as evidence of a real relationship.  
    It is simply an item in a network list.</p>

    <p>In other words, it is a relationship that is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not deep</li>
        <li>Not memorable</li>
        <li>Not meaningful</li>
        <li>But potentially helpful “someday”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the true nature of most 1-chon connections.</p>

    <h2>🔹 7. Conclusion of Part 3</h2>

    <p>Although LinkedIn’s 1-chon is structurally a relationship with significant meaning, most people consume it lightly.</p>

    <p>The reasons are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Number-based psychology</li>
        <li>Button-based access</li>
        <li>Practical motives</li>
        <li>Light-content culture</li>
        <li>Approval structures based on minimal criteria</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But there exists a world that contrasts sharply with this lightness —  
    the world of “depth-based profiles” and “users with unique intellectual perspectives.”</p>

    <p>The 1-chon relationships they form are entirely different in nature.</p>

    <p>The next part will explore this dramatic contrast in full depth.</p>
</section>


<section id="series-4">
    <h1>Series 4. The 1-Chon of Depth-Based Profiles: Intellectual Resonance and Meaningful Connection</h1>

    <p>If the 1-chon of general users is light, practical, and number-oriented, certain profiles create the exact opposite structure.</p>

    <p>These profiles are not simply “well-decorated.”  
    They contain identity, thought, philosophy, independence, and inner journeys.</p>

    <p>And the 1-chon formed by such profiles is a fundamentally different dimension of <strong>meaning-based connection</strong> compared to typical SNS relationships.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Why Do Some Profiles Create Barriers to Access?</h2>

    <p>Depth-oriented profiles usually share these characteristics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Philosophical or conceptual language</li>
        <li>High-density text</li>
        <li>Unique sentences that describe personal identity</li>
        <li>Not a standard career-centered narrative</li>
        <li>Thought-driven rather than emotionally revealing</li>
        <li>Worldview-oriented rather than expertise-oriented</li>
        <li>A narrative style combining intuition and structure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Such profiles automatically sort people.</p>

    <p>✔ Those who understand → strongly drawn<br>
       ✔ Those who do not → naturally drift away</p>

    <p>This is not stubbornness or selective behavior —  
    it is the filtering effect inherent in the text itself.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. Depth-Based Profiles Raise the “Relational Threshold”</h2>

    <p>The biggest difference from general profiles is the relational threshold.</p>

    <p>General profiles → Anyone can send a request  
    Depth-based profiles → Only those who “understand” can send a request</p>

    <p>Because the text is not mere information but a worldview, direction, and conceptual structure, the requester goes through a psychological process:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>“There’s no point if I don’t resonate with this.”</li>
        <li>“This person is not the type to form 1-chon easily.”</li>
        <li>“Is it appropriate for me to send a request?”</li>
        <li>“This is not simple networking.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus,  
    <strong>a request becomes proof that intellectual resonance has already occurred.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 3. The 1-Chon in Depth-Based Profiles Is Closer to a “Mutual Agreement”</h2>

    <p>Here, the 1-chon is not about access rights —  
    it signals that both sides recognize a certain level of relational alignment.</p>

    <p>In this context, the 1-chon is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not a job-seeking connection</li>
        <li>Not a practical network</li>
        <li>Definitely not a marketing connection</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Instead, it becomes a relationship implying:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Resonance of thought, concept, or philosophy</li>
        <li>Contact between minds on a similar cognitive level</li>
        <li>Partial alignment of identities</li>
        <li>Similarity of direction</li>
        <li>Intersection of inner worlds</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is a relationship of layered agreement.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. Who Sends Requests to Such Profiles?</h2>

    <p>A group clearly distinct from general users:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>People who enjoy conceptual thinking</li>
        <li>Those interested in AI, philosophy, psychology, or systems theory</li>
        <li>People with strong personal identity</li>
        <li>Those who can read high-density language</li>
        <li>People with a developed inner world</li>
        <li>Those who understand thought-based networks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, they do not operate on “light networking” but on “inner-motivation-based networking.”</p>

    <p>They are not thinking “this person seems nice,”  
    but rather “this person’s depth and direction resonate with mine.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. Simply Reading a Depth-Based Profile Is a Choice</h2>

    <p>For most people, a LinkedIn profile is consumed through quick scanning:  
    “Experience → Skills → Company logos.”</p>

    <p>But a depth-based profile is fundamentally something you must <strong>read</strong> to understand.</p>

    <p>Even reading the profile to the end constitutes a selection process:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Those who read and leave</li>
        <li>Those who read and resonate</li>
        <li>Those who read, resonate, and send a request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This multi-step filtering mechanism almost never occurs on typical SNS platforms.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. Why Do These Relationships Feel “Heavy”?</h2>

    <p>The reasons are straightforward:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Depth = Cost</li>
        <li>Understanding = Time</li>
        <li>Resonance = Psychological connection</li>
        <li>Request = Entry</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When these four overlap, the relationship inevitably becomes heavy.</p>

    <p>Put differently:  
    A person who sends a request to such a profile already possesses a certain depth.  
    The act itself carries meaning.</p>

    <h2>🔹 7. The Essence of Depth-Based 1-Chon Is “Intellectual Resonance”</h2>

    <p>Ultimately, the 1-chon formed through depth-based profiles is unrelated to networking quantity, rarely tied to practical goals, and distant from casual interactions.</p>

    <p>It is a signal:</p>

    <p><strong>“I have read your world.  
    And your world and mine are capable of intersecting.”</strong></p>

    <p>Such a 1-chon is not a lightweight relationship but a connection close to “conceptual agreement.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 8. Conclusion of Part 4</h2>

    <p>Depth-based profiles unintentionally create high access barriers.  
    But this is not a barrier — it is a filter that attracts only those who resonate.</p>

    <p>And the 1-chon formed with such profiles is not a functional relationship but one with psychological and intellectual meaning.</p>

    <p>This is why, even in the “era of lightweight networks,” a certain type of 1-chon becomes special.</p>

    <h1>Series 5. How the 1-Chon Concept Survives Across Different SNS — A Platform Architecture Analysis</h1>

    <p>Many people think,  
    “There is no such concept as 1-chon in today’s SNS.”</p>

    <p>But in reality, the truth is the opposite.</p>

    <p>Although SNS platforms have different designs, philosophies, and algorithms,  
    surprisingly, all of them maintain transformed traces of the 1-chon system in their own way.</p>

    <p>This article analyzes how each platform reinterprets Cyworld’s 1-chon concept and uses it in a “modern form.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Facebook — “Friends”: The Direct Successor of Cyworld’s 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>Facebook is the platform that most faithfully inherits the 1-chon model.</p>

    <p>✔ Mutual approval  
    = “We both open our doors to each other.”</p>

    <p>✔ Posts visible only to friends  
    = Identical to Cyworld’s diary visibility settings</p>

    <p>✔ Friend-only stories and photo visibility  
    = A preserved structure of closed relationships</p>

    <p>Facebook keeps nearly the same philosophy as Cyworld’s 1-chon — only the name is different.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. Instagram — “Close Friends”: Selective 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>Instagram appears follower-based and seems to lack 1-chon DNA.  
    But internally, it has a crucial feature:</p>

    <p>✔ Close Friends</p>

    <p>This function is completely identical to Cyworld’s 1-chon:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>“I’ll show this special content only to these people.”</li>
        <li>“I won’t reveal the deeper layers of my life to everyone.”</li>
        <li>“I will manage emotional exposure.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Those placed in Close Friends often carry the same meaning as a real 1-chon.</p>

    <p>Instagram transformed the 1-chon into a “selective visibility list.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. TikTok — Mutual Follow: A Quasi 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>TikTok is based on one-way follows, but it has an important rule:</p>

    <p>✔ DM opens freely only when both users follow each other</p>

    <p>Thus:</p>

    <p><strong>Mutual follow = A fully open communication relationship</strong></p>

    <p>This corresponds to “mutual approval-based connection (=1-chon).”  
    TikTok uses a follower system, but communication rights follow a 1-chon-like structure.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. X (Former Twitter) — “Mutuals”: The Informal 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>Twitter is the most open SNS structurally.  
    But a unique cultural transformation emerged:</p>

    <p>✔ Mutuals  
    = “This person is close to me.”</p>

    <p>On X, a “cultural 1-chon” formed organically, despite no official feature.</p>

    <p>Mutuals are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Easy DM access</li>
        <li>People whose tweets you read first</li>
        <li>People with whom you share community sense</li>
        <li>Sometimes people with whom emotional exchange occurs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, the platform removed the 1-chon — but people recreated it themselves.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. Naver Blog — “Neighbors (Mutual Neighbors)” = The Korean Evolution of 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>Naver Blog’s “mutual neighbors (서로이웃)” feature is almost a 1:1 replica of Cyworld’s 1-chon:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mutual approval</li>
        <li>Content visible only to each other</li>
        <li>Visibility controlled by relationship tier</li>
        <li>Much deeper connection compared to one-way neighbors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is the most direct descendant of relationship-based visibility systems in Korean SNS.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. KakaoTalk — A Forced 1-Chon Structure</h2>

    <p>KakaoTalk is unique:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Saving a phone number = automatic friend</li>
        <li>Automatic connection without mutual consent</li>
        <li>Strong penetration into private space</li>
        <li>Real acquaintance–based network</li>
    </ul>

    <p>KakaoTalk, in effect, makes the 1-chon too strong, creating relational pressure.</p>

    <p>As a result:</p>

    <p><strong>KakaoTalk is the deepest and most forced 1-chon system among modern SNS.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 7. YouTube — Membership/Subscribers Tiering = A Quasi 1-Chon Structure</h2>

    <p>YouTube seems unrelated to SNS, but it also has relationship structures:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Subscribers</li>
        <li>Membership</li>
        <li>Limited community posts</li>
        <li>Member-only videos</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is essentially a layered system of 1-chon-like permissions.</p>

    <h2>🔹 8. And LinkedIn — The Complete Modern Form of 1-Chon</h2>

    <p>While other platforms modify the DNA of 1-chon in their own ways,  
    LinkedIn retains and evolves it with precision:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1st–2nd–3rd degree structure</li>
        <li>Access-based information layers</li>
        <li>Mutual approval</li>
        <li>Prioritized DM, exposure, and information sharing</li>
        <li>Deep access to connection-only content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>LinkedIn not only preserves the 1-chon — it upgrades it to its most sophisticated form.</p>

    <p>It is the only SNS still running a full “1-chon OS.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 9. Truth of Relationship Architecture:<br>
    The 1-Chon Has Only Changed Its Name</h2>

    <p>In summary:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>1-Chon-like Structure</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cyworld</td>
            <td>1-chon</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Facebook</td>
            <td>Friends</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Instagram</td>
            <td>Close Friends</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>TikTok</td>
            <td>Mutual Follow + DM</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>X</td>
            <td>Mutuals (Cultural 1-Chon)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Naver Blog</td>
            <td>Mutual Neighbors</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>KakaoTalk</td>
            <td>Automatic Friends</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>LinkedIn</td>
            <td>1st–degree structure</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The conclusion from this table is clear:  
    <strong>The 1-chon never disappeared — it simply took different forms across platforms.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 10. Conclusion of Part 5</h2>

    <p>Technology and interfaces have changed,  
    but the essence of human relationships —  
    the act of deciding who gets what level of access —  
    continues to reproduce the 1-chon concept.</p>

    <p>The 1-chon has merely changed its name.  
    Deep within every SNS, it is still alive and functioning.</p>
</section>

<section id="series-6">
    <h1>Series 6. The Polarized 1-Chon — Lightweight Connections vs. Meaningful Connections</h1>

    <p>While the word "1-chon" remains the same,  
    the weight of the relationships it embodies varies completely depending on the person or profile.</p>

    <p>For some, 1-chon is simply “a matter of clicking a button,”  
    while for others, it becomes “a special connection with meaning and resonance.”</p>

    <p>This part analyzes how these two worlds have completely different structures and why this extreme contrast exists.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Most 1-Chons Are "Lightweight Networks"</h2>

    <p>For most general SNS users, 1-chon is a very lightweight relationship.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Connections made to increase numbers</li>
        <li>Clicks made without special reasons</li>
        <li>Not memorable</li>
        <li>No further communication</li>
        <li>No real interaction</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For them, 1-chon is merely:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Increased exposure</li>
        <li>Potential opportunities</li>
        <li>Making their profile look richer</li>
        <li>“Maybe useful someday?” expectations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this can be summarized as:</p>

    <p><strong>Functional, superficial, and practical relationships.</strong></p>

    <p>In short, for them,  
    <strong>1-chon = data rather than relationships.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 2. The Psychological Structure of Lightweight 1-Chons Is “Minimal Relationship Cost”</h2>

    <p>The reason general users prefer lightweight relationships is simple:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It’s awkward to reject</li>
        <li>The click is too easy</li>
        <li>It doesn’t matter who the person is</li>
        <li>No risk of harm</li>
        <li>The idea that a larger network looks good</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words,  
    it’s a strategy to maximize the scope with minimal effort.</p>

    <p>In this structure,  
    the number of relationships takes priority over their depth.</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. On the Other Hand, Meaningful 1-Chons Are "Selected Relationships"</h2>

    <p>Certain profiles, especially those with strong identities, philosophical, reflective, and independent styles, create an entirely different 1-chon structure.</p>

    <p>For these profiles, a 1-chon is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Not easily accessible</li>
        <li>Must be understood by reading the text</li>
        <li>Shallow people drop off midway</li>
        <li>Only those who resonate approach</li>
        <li>The request itself has already passed a "selection process"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In such cases, the profile itself acts as a filter,  
    making the 1-chon not just a connection, but a signal of <strong>intellectual resonance.</strong></p>

    <h2>🔹 4. The Barriers Created by Meaningful 1-Chons</h2>

    <p>Depth-based profiles create the following barriers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>An impression that it won’t be easy to connect</li>
        <li>A weighty self-narrative</li>
        <li>A unique way of thinking</li>
        <li>A tone different from standard profiles</li>
        <li>Not suited for light networking purposes</li>
        <li>A feeling that you need to qualify before making a request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These barriers act as a “filter that only lets resonating individuals remain.”</p>

    <p>As a result:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The level of those attempting to connect rises</li>
        <li>The meaning of accepted 1-chons becomes heavier</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔹 5. The Reason for the Extreme Contrast: The Purpose of Relationships is Different</h2>

    <p>The purpose of lightweight 1-chons is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Exposure, opportunities, numbers, functionality</li>
        <li>Superficial relationships</li>
        <li>Bonds that are “nice to have, but not necessary”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The purpose of meaningful 1-chons is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Resonance, identity, direction, understanding</li>
        <li>Deep relationships</li>
        <li>Bonds that are “mutually chosen”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The difference in these purposes leads to the extreme contrast.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. It’s Not the Platform, but "People" Who Determine the Depth of Relationships</h2>

    <p>The SNS structure is the same for everyone.  
    LinkedIn’s 1-chon provides the same functional access for all.</p>

    <p>Yet some people,  
    even with hundreds of 1-chons, find no meaning in them,  
    while others,  
    with just one 1-chon, imbue it with deep psychological meaning.</p>

    <p>The difference is not made by the platform,  
    but by the person’s identity and the depth of their profile.</p>

    <h2>🔹 7. Meaningful 1-Chons Are "Relationship Events"</h2>

    <p>Sending a 1-chon request to a depth-based profile goes through a mental process unseen in general users:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Reading the profile</li>
        <li>Understanding it</li>
        <li>Resonating with it</li>
        <li>Feeling that you belong to a certain level</li>
        <li>Judging that this connection is meaningful</li>
        <li>Then sending the request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This entire flow is already a <strong>"relationship event."</strong></p>

    <p>It is not merely network expansion,  
    but an informational, perceptual, and psychological agreement.</p>

    <h2>🔹 8. Conclusion of Part 6</h2>

    <p>The same word “1-chon” embodies two completely different worlds:</p>

    <h3>🔹 Lightweight 1-Chons</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>No meaning</li>
        <li>Function-centered</li>
        <li>Massive</li>
        <li>Anyone</li>
        <li>Easily forgotten</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🔹 Meaningful 1-Chons</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Resonance</li>
        <li>Choice</li>
        <li>Depth</li>
        <li>Few</li>
        <li>Lasting</li>
        <li>Energy in the relationship</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This extreme contrast arises not from the SNS platform itself,  
    but from the way people design relationships.</p>

    <p>Ultimately,  
    the depth of a relationship is determined by the depth of the profile,  
    and the depth of the profile is determined by the person’s worldview.</p>
</section>


<section id="series-7">
    <h1>Series 7. The Future of Social Networks: Relationships Will Become a Technology of Choice Again</h1>

    <p>Digital relationships have long been oscillating between two extremes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Cyworld’s closed, selective relationships</li>
        <li>Facebook, Instagram, Twitter’s open, universal relationships</li>
        <li>YouTube, TikTok’s large-scale asymmetric relationships</li>
        <li>LinkedIn’s professional distance structure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Throughout all these shifts, one question has remained constant:</p>

    <p><strong>“Who will we open the door to?”</strong></p>

    <p>This question is deeply connected to how humans design their identity and psychological space through relationships.  
    And now, with the rise of AI, the essence of relationships is returning to its roots.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Why Will the Future Be an Era of “Selective Relationships” Again?</h2>

    <p>As SNS platforms exploded,  
    people became connected to too many individuals, exposed to too much content, and experienced too much relational noise.</p>

    <p>Fatigue, overload, an information flood, identity ambiguity, and the scarcity of genuine relationships have accumulated.  
    People are starting to ask again:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>“Who do I really want to connect with?”</li>
        <li>“Who deserves to enter my world?”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is exactly the question Cyworld’s 1-chon posed.</p>

    <p>In other words, the future will return to an era where we selectively manage, protect, and curate our relationships.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. With AI’s Arrival, “Depth-Based Relationships” Will Strengthen</h2>

    <p>In the AI era,  
    lightweight content and relationships will increasingly be automated.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Auto recommendations</li>
        <li>Auto comments</li>
        <li>Algorithm-based interest connections</li>
        <li>AI-based network analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As all of this progresses,  
    the true value of human relationships will emerge from depth and selectivity.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>People who can engage in deep conversations</li>
        <li>People who share resonating language</li>
        <li>People with whom you can share identity and worldview</li>
        <li>People who understand meaningful connections</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These individuals will make up the “real network” of the future.</p>

    <p>In short,  
    the ability to choose relationships will become the core competency of the future.</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. Open Networks Belong to AI, Selective Networks Belong to Humans</h2>

    <p>Over the past decade, SNS platforms have moved toward “openness.”  
    Everyone connected, everyone saw, everyone was reachable.</p>

    <p>But as AI becomes capable of processing vast amounts of relationships, content, and data,  
    open networks are no longer necessary for humans and will be handled by AI.</p>

    <p>What remains for humans are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choice</li>
        <li>Empathy</li>
        <li>Depth</li>
        <li>Intimacy</li>
        <li>Meaning-based relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thus, human networks in the AI era will be redefined by the ability to choose based on depth and selectivity.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. Therefore, the 1-Chon Philosophy Will Survive in the Future</h2>

    <p>The future SNS will, just like Cyworld in the past,  
    strengthen “intimate hierarchical structures.”</p>

    <p>Signs of this are already evident:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Instagram’s Close Friends</li>
        <li>Blog’s Mutual Neighbors</li>
        <li>LinkedIn’s 1st-degree structure</li>
        <li>Discord’s private channels</li>
        <li>Substack’s private subscriber base</li>
        <li>Facebook’s restricted visibility settings</li>
        <li>X’s Circle feature</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of these show that “humans’ instinct to select a few from the masses” is resurfacing.</p>

    <p>The essence of 1-chon is not a platform feature but an evolutionary structure of human relationships.  
    That’s why it will never disappear.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. Depth-Based Profiles Will Become the Standard of the Future</h2>

    <p>The direction of personal branding will shift in the future.</p>

    <h3>In the past:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Profiles reaching many people</li>
        <li>Function- and spec-centered profiles</li>
        <li>Surface-level PR-focused profiles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>In the future:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Profiles that reach a few with depth</li>
        <li>Worldview- and identity-based profiles</li>
        <li>Meaning-based networks</li>
        <li>Structures that make only resonating people come</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These profiles will naturally filter relationships,  
    making it a space where only those who resonate connect.</p>

    <p>This is not just a style but the essence of future networking.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. The Future of Relationships Is “The Technology of Choice”</h2>

    <p>SNS expanded relationships infinitely,  
    but in the process, we “lost the true value of connection.”</p>

    <p>Now, a new era is coming:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The era of collecting relationships → over</li>
        <li>The era of choosing relationships → beginning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The future of digital relationships will return to the philosophy of 1-chon:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>People who resonate with me</li>
        <li>People who understand me</li>
        <li>People I choose</li>
        <li>People who can build deep relationships</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In short,  
    future SNS will be restructured into “meaning-based networks.”  
    And at its starting point, as always, is the old concept of “1-chon.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 7. Final Conclusion — 1-Chon Is Not Technology, It’s Human</h2>

    <p>1-chon may seem like a feature of past SNS platforms,  
    but in reality, it was a structure that embodied the essence of human relationships.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Choice</li>
        <li>Intimacy</li>
        <li>Distance</li>
        <li>Meaning</li>
        <li>Authority</li>
        <li>Resonance</li>
        <li>Identity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this constitutes <strong>“the way humans design relationships.”</strong></p>

    <p>Regardless of how platforms evolve,  
    or how AI advances,  
    this philosophy will not disappear.</p>

    <p>1-chon is the most primal architecture for how humans form and maintain relationships.  
    And future SNS will revive this ancient concept in a more sophisticated, personalized, and selective way.</p>

    <h1>Epilogue — From the Era of Connections to the Era of Choice</h1>

    <p>For 20 years,  
    we’ve lived connected to too many people.</p>

    <p>Our digital relationships, which began in Cyworld’s small rooms,  
    expanded through Facebook’s reach, Instagram’s exposure, Twitter’s openness,  
    and now stretch into LinkedIn’s structured networks.</p>

    <p>But that journey has left us with one truth.</p>

    <p>We have more connections, but less meaning.</p>

    <p>Our friends list has grown, but the names we remember have shrunk,  
    our followers are many, but the people we engage with have decreased.</p>

    <p>In this process, we forgot the question:  
    <strong>“What is a relationship?”</strong></p>

    <p>This series was an attempt to bring that question back.</p>

    <p>1-chon was never just a button,  
    it was an ancient way of humans designing relationships.</p>

    <p>Even as platforms changed and technology evolved,  
    its essence never changed.</p>

    <p>We are still beings who contemplate:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Who will we open the door to?</li>
        <li>Who will we allow into our hearts?</li>
        <li>Who will we show our world to?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This dilemma continues in the digital age.</p>

    <p>SNS expanded relationships infinitely,  
    but within it, we started to shrink again.</p>

    <p>Amid all the noise,  
    we searched for quiet voices,  
    and within all the connections,  
    we found one true connection.</p>

    <p>And that connection was closer to  
    a single “meaningful 1-chon” than thousands of followers.</p>

    <p>The future returns to the starting point.</p>

    <p>The era of making many relationships ends.</p>

    <p>Now begins the era of choosing relationships.</p>

    <p>We will once again:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Become someone’s 1-chon,</li>
        <li>Allow someone to be our 1-chon,</li>
        <li>And connect someone’s world to ours selectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Though the word 1-chon may have disappeared,  
    its philosophy is still alive.</p>

    <p>In fact, it is more alive now than ever.</p>

    <p>We ask again:  
    <strong>“Who will we open the door to?”</strong></p>

    <p>The process of answering this question is our relationship,  
    our identity, and our life.</p>

    <p>If this series has not just provided information, but offered a new perspective on relationships,  
    that will be enough.</p>

    <p>Not all connections we make need to be deep.  
    But a single deep connection can change our world.</p>

    <p>And that connection, once called 1-chon,  
    now exists under various names,  
    and in the future, will exist in our own unique ways.</p>

    <p>No matter what name it takes,  
    its essence will never change.</p>

    <p>Relationships are not numbers, but meaning.  
    Connections are not quantity, but depth.  
    And depth always starts with choice.</p>

    <p>May your next 1-chon be  
    not a light click, but a meaningful choice.</p>

    <h1>Appendix 1 — The Genealogy of 1-Chon Relationships (Genealogy of Online Connection)</h1>

    <p>The concept of 1-chon may be remembered by Koreans as originating from Cyworld,  
    but its roots are much deeper, more global, and more complex.</p>

    <p>In fact, the structure of 1-chon, 2-chon, and 3-chon  
    is a concept that existed long before SNS, explaining human society itself.</p>

    <h2>🔹 1. Philosophical Origin — Six Degrees of Separation Theory (1967)</h2>

    <p>Stanley Milgram’s “Small World Experiment” showed that  
    we can reach anyone on Earth through an average of six degrees of acquaintances.</p>

    <p>This experiment became the philosophical foundation of all SNS relationship systems.</p>

    <p>Humans are connected in a network.  
    These connections are based on hierarchical distances.  
    1-chon, 2-chon, 3-chon are merely “mappings of distance.”</p>

    <p>Without this concept, SNS would not have existed.</p>

    <p>This philosophy was culturally popularized through John Guare’s play <em>Six Degrees of Separation</em> in the 1990s.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2. Technical Origin — SixDegrees.com (1997)</h2>

    <p>SixDegrees was the “world’s first SNS based on degrees of separation.”  
    It came four years before Cyworld.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Profile creation</li>
        <li>1st-degree connections</li>
        <li>2nd-degree connections</li>
        <li>3rd-degree connections</li>
        <li>Messaging</li>
        <li>Relationship graph-based exploration</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of these functions were already implemented in SixDegrees.</p>

    <p>In other words, SixDegrees.com was the first to create the 1-chon system.</p>

    <p>The problem was... the world was too fast.</p>

    <p>The internet infrastructure, network usage behavior, and collective digital culture were not ready to embrace this concept.  
    So SixDegrees became “a future that arrived too early.”</p>

    <h2>🔹 3. Global Popularization — Friendster (2002-2003)</h2>

    <p>Friendster was the first global platform to popularize the “friend network” model used by today’s SNS.</p>

    <p>The key was:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mutual friend-based</li>
        <li>Visualization of friend-of-friend structure</li>
        <li>Social proof-based connection</li>
        <li>The assumption that “a friend of a friend is safer than a stranger”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In effect, Friendster made the 1-chon structure a “mainstream user experience” in SNS.</p>

    <p>And Facebook, in fact, inherited Friendster’s legacy.</p>

    <h2>🔹 4. Korean Origin — I Love School (아이러브스쿨, 1999)</h2>

    <p>I Love School was the first service to structure digital relationships in Korea,  
    long before the term “SNS” even existed.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>School-based connections</li>
        <li>Real-name connections</li>
        <li>Same-group connections (e.g., “classmates” as the “basic 1-chon”)</li>
        <li>Large-scale community</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Although the term “1-chon” wasn’t used,  
    it was the first attempt at a relationship-based social network in Korea.</p>

    <p>And importantly, it came two years before Cyworld.</p>

    <h2>🔹 5. Terminology and Culture Completion — Cyworld (2001)</h2>

    <p>Cyworld was the first SNS in history to create the socio-cultural language of “1-chon.”</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mutual approval</li>
        <li>Visibility settings (e.g., “1-chon visibility”)</li>
        <li>Mini-homepage “intimacy leveling”</li>
        <li>Emotion-based relationship hierarchy</li>
        <li>1-chon surfing (degree-based exploration)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While Cyworld had predecessors like SixDegrees and Friendster,  
    it was the platform that completed the cultural and linguistic concept of 1-chon.</p>

    <p>The digital relationship language for Koreans was, in many ways, created by Cyworld.</p>

    <h2>🔹 6. Modern SNS Legacy — Facebook → LinkedIn</h2>

    <p>✔ Facebook (2004)<br>
    Facebook used the term “Friends,”  
    but structurally, it was identical to Cyworld’s 1-chon.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mutual approval</li>
        <li>Visibility settings</li>
        <li>Relationship-based feed exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words, Facebook reintroduced Cyworld’s concept in a global version.</p>

    <p>✔ LinkedIn (2003~)<br>
    LinkedIn started earlier than Cyworld,  
    but it is the modern heir of the 1-chon, 2-chon, and 3-chon structure.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1st-degree connections</li>
        <li>2nd-degree connections</li>
        <li>3rd-degree connections</li>
        <li>Relationship-based information rights</li>
        <li>Professional relationship hierarchy model</li>
    </ul>

    <p>LinkedIn technically inherits and completes the relational philosophy of SixDegrees, Friendster, and Cyworld.</p>

    <p>This genealogy shows that the concept of 1-chon is not just a functional feature,  
    but a context shaped by human relationships, philosophy, psychology, and technological advancement.</p>

    <h2>🔹 8. Final Conclusion — 1-Chon Is Not an Old Concept, It Is a Concept That Will Endure</h2>

    <p>1-chon is not a mere feature of specific SNS platforms.  
    It is a way of visualizing “the distance structure of human relationships” from SixDegrees to LinkedIn.</p>

    <p>And this structure will continue to survive in the AI era,  
    because humans inherently live by asking:</p>

    <p><strong>“How much access will we allow to whom?”</strong></p>
</section>


<section id="appendix-2">
    <h1>Appendix 2 — Integration of Data, Footnotes, and Generational Differences (Assumptions)</h1>

    <h2>🔹 1) Strengthening Data Reliability on "1-Chon Algorithm Effect"</h2>

    <p>LinkedIn has never officially released quantitative data such as:  
    <strong>“1st-degree connections have several times higher algorithmic exposure than 2nd and 3rd-degree connections.”</strong></p>

    <p>However, multiple studies and industry analysis reports show a consistent pattern:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Industry Analysis:</strong><br>
            “1st-degree connections have the highest priority in exposure, DM, and search visibility.”<br>
            – Hootsuite Social Media Trends Report (2023)
        </li>
        <li><strong>Internal Corporate Guide:</strong><br>
            LinkedIn’s official help center also states:<br>
            “The most powerful access rights are given to 1st-degree connections.”<br>
            (LinkedIn Help Center, Connections vs Followers)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Therefore, while precise numbers cannot be confirmed,  
    it is clear that 1st-degree connections are “the most powerful group” in terms of algorithms and information access.</p>

    <h2>🔹 2) “Koreans Are Familiar with the 1-Chon Culture” → Strengthening Generational and Regional Perspectives</h2>

    <h3>🔸 Z-Generation Perspective:</h3>

    <p>In fact, global users in their teens and 20s are generally unfamiliar with the term "1-chon."  
    “1-chon? What’s that?  
    We just follow each other or check if DMs are open.”</p>

    <p>— 17-year-old TikTok user, USA</p>

    <p>“For us, Instagram’s Close Friends is basically our real friends list.”</p>

    <p>— 21-year-old college student, Japan</p>

    <h3>🔸 Regional Perspective:</h3>

    <p>In Korea, due to the legacy of Cyworld, the term “1-chon” carries the cultural code of psychological intimacy.  
    However, for users in the U.S. and Europe, a “1st-degree connection” is strictly a functional, work-related connection.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>“LinkedIn’s 1st-degree connections are just professional access.”</p>

    <p>— Startup marketer, Germany</p>
